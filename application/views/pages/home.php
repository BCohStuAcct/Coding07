            <p>The most important thing to recognize about climate change is its roots in capitalism. 
            <br>
            Capitalism is the driving force of climate change. It's behind the push by oil companies to spend billions in order to discredit climate science. 
            <br>
            Any efforts to stop the climate crisis that does not recognize this will ultimately end in failure.
            <br>
            We no longer have time to lose.
            <br>
            The time to act is now.
